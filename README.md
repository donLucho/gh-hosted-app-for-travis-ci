# GH-Hosted App for Travis-CI

## Description
A starting point for a Travis-CI workflow for use with GitHub. 

## GH-Pages branch created
Travis-CI for GitHub is a novel idea. 

CI/CD is not only limited to GitLab. 

Hence, with a little investigation one can view the *the final product* without having to upload a **build** folder (e.g. - React) or a **dist** folder (e.g. - Angular), etc., etc. 

Feel free to [visit the gh-pages prezzo](https://donlucho.github.io/gh-hosted-app-for-travis-ci/ "link to gh-pages prezzo") in order to get a taste for what Travis-CI can do to enhance your GitHub projects.
